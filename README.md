'Cases' is a time series recording COVID-19 Deaths, Cases, Recoveries and Hospitalisation in each region of the UK. It contains additional geographical information relating to the region. Each record relates to a day's observation although the primary key is the record number and not the day to which the obersavations relates to.  


'Tweets' contains Twitter data between 15 May 2020 and 23 May 2020. It looks like these are tweets which contain  trending handles about COVID-19 during this period


'Vaccinated' contains a time series recording total COVID-19 vacinnations in each region of the UK between January 2020 and Oct 2021. The data records the number of first, second and total doses adminstered for each day in each region. 


**Did you notice anything interesting about the data?** The data sets whilst purpoting to be real world are unlikely to be. Perhaps in the interest of masking the data, the relative scales of the data sets versus actual population in each of the real world locations are vastly out of sync. This is very off putting & prevented the generation of some additional potentially powerful insights using actual population data. However, for the academic purposes of this exercise, the data being mis-scaled didnt impede the display of the analytical techniques which we were taught to deploy. 


**What are some of the initial insights you've discovered?** No major insights so far from Twitter data; its too small. The remainder of the data set was noisy but useful to visualise and combine with the Twitter data to pencil in a story board.


All my observations arising from the data analysis are noted in the Jupyter noteblock underneath the corresponding code block.


The overall conclusions + methodology, background & problem statement are outlined in the written report in PDF.


The Jupyter notebook with all the codes, rationale, functions & visualisations is the final output of all the weekly assignments and saved as ipnyb file. All major visualisations within the notebook have been exported and saved as png files.


A short video recording presenting the key insights, trends, patterns & recommendations; saved as mp4.
